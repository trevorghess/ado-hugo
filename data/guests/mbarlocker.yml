"Bio": "I'm a startup fanatic. Creating businesses, teams, products, and process are where I thrive. My background is in software engineering, so I prefer deep tech companies, like Blue Matador, my software monitoring startup. In my spare time, you'll find me flying airplanes, playing luckless board games, riding my side-by-side, playing the piano, or learning new skills and languages (sailing & Italian on the shortlist)."
